Multisignature
==============

Multisignature transactions are transactions which require multiple signatures before execution. In simplest example it means that, if there is token wallet which require 5 signatures from different parties, all 5 parties must sign spent transaction, before it will be processed.

It is standard functionality in blockchain systems and it is also implemented in IOTA

.. note::

    You can read more about IOTA multisignature on the `wiki`_.

Generating multisignature address
---------------------------------

In order to use multisignature functionality, a special multisignature address must be created. It is done by adding each key digest in agreed order into digests list. At the end, last participant is converting digests list (Curl state trits) into multisignature address.

.. note::

    Each multisignature addresses participant has to create its own digest locally. Then, when it is created it can be safely shared with other participants, in order to build list of digests which then will be converted into multisignature address.

    Created digests should be shared with each multisignature participant, so each one of them could regenerate address and ensure it is OK.

Here is the example where digest is created:

.. code-block:: python

    # Create digest 3 of 3.
    api_3 =\
      MultisigIota(
        adapter = 'http://localhost:14265',

        seed =
          Seed(
            b'TESTVALUE9DONTUSEINPRODUCTION99999JYFRTI'
            b'WMKVVBAIEIYZDWLUVOYTZBKPKLLUMPDF9PPFLO9KT',
          ),
      )

    gd_result = api_3.get_digests(index=8, count=1, security_level=2)

    digest_3 = gd_result['digests'][0] # type: Digest

And here is example where digests are converted into multisignature address:

.. code-block:: python

    cma_result =\
      api_1.create_multisig_address(digests=[digest_1,
                                             digest_2,
                                             digest_3])

    # For consistency, every API command returns a dict, even if it only
    # has a single value.
    multisig_address = cma_result['address'] # type: MultisigAddress

.. note::

    As you can see in above example, multisignature addresses is created from list of digests, and in this case **order** is important. The same order need to be used in **signing transfer**.




Prepare transfer
------------------

.. note::

    Since spending tokens from the same address more than once is insecure, remainder should be transferred to other address. So, this address should be created before as next to be used multisignature address.

First signer for multisignature wallet is defining address where tokens should be transferred and next wallet address for reminder:

.. code-block:: python

    pmt_result =\
      api_1.prepare_multisig_transfer(
        # These are the transactions that will spend the IOTAs.
        # You can divide up the IOTAs to send to multiple addresses if you
        # want, but to keep this example focused, we will only include a
        # single spend transaction.
        transfers = [
          ProposedTransaction(
            address =
              Address(
                b'TESTVALUE9DONTUSEINPRODUCTION99999NDGYBC'
                b'QZJFGGWZ9GBQFKDOLWMVILARZRHJMSYFZETZTHTZR',
              ),

            value = 42,

            # If you'd like, you may include an optional tag and/or
            # message.
            tag = Tag(b'KITTEHS'),
            message = TryteString.from_unicode('thanx fur cheezburgers'),
          ),
        ],

        # Specify our multisig address as the input for the spend
        # transaction(s).
        # Note that PyOTA currently only allows one multisig input per
        # bundle (although the protocol does not impose a limit).
        multisig_input = multisig_address,

        # If there will be change from this transaction, you MUST specify
        # the change address!  Unlike regular transfers, multisig transfers
        # will NOT automatically generate a change address; that wouldn't
        # be fair to the other participants!
        change_address = None,
      )

    prepared_trytes = pmt_result['trytes'] # type: List[TransactionTrytes]


Sign the inputs
---------------

When trytes are prepared, round of signing must be performed. Order of signing must be the same as in generate multisignature addresses procedure (as described above).

.. note::

    In example below, all signing is done on one local machine. In real case, each participant sign bundle locally and then passes it to next participant in previously defined order

    **index**, **count** and **security_lavel** parameters for each private key should be the same as used in **get_digests** function in previous steps.

.. code-block:: python

    bundle = Bundle.from_tryte_strings(prepared_trytes)

    gpk_result = api_1.get_private_keys(index=0, count=1, security_level=3)
    private_key_1 = gpk_result['keys'][0] # type: PrivateKey
    private_key_1.sign_input_transactions(bundle, 1)

    gpk_result = api_2.get_private_keys(index=42, count=1, security_level=3)
    private_key_2 = gpk_result['keys'][0] # type: PrivateKey
    private_key_2.sign_input_transactions(bundle, 4)

    gpk_result = api_3.get_private_keys(index=8, count=1, security_level=2)
    private_key_3 = gpk_result['keys'][0] # type: PrivateKey
    private_key_3.sign_input_transactions(bundle, 7)

    signed_trytes = bundle.as_tryte_strings()

.. note::

    After creation, bundle can be optionally validated:

    .. code-block:: python

        validator = BundleValidator(bundle)
        if not validator.is_valid():
          raise ValueError(
            'Bundle failed validation:\n{errors}'.format(
              errors = '\n'.join(('  - ' + e) for e in validator.errors),
            ),
          )



Broadcast the bundle
--------------------

When bundle is created it can be broadcasted in standard way:

.. code-block:: python

    api_1.send_trytes(trytes=signed_trytes, depth=3)

    How M-of-N works

    One of the key differences between IOTA multi-signatures is that M-of-N (e.g. 3 of 5) works differently. What this means is that in order to successfully spend inputs, all of the co-signers have to sign the transaction. As such, in order to enable M-of-N we have to make use of a simple trick: sharing of private keys.

    This concept is best explained with a concrete example:

        Lets say that we have a multi-signature between 3 parties: Alice, Bob and Carol. Each has their own private key, and they generated a new multi-signature address in the aforementioned order. Currently, this is a 3 of 3 multisig. This means that all 3 participants (Alice, Bob and Carol) need to sign the inputs with their private keys in order to successfully spend them.

        In order to enable a 2 of 3 multisig, the cosigners need to share their private keys with the other parties in such a way that no single party can sign inputs alone, but that still enables an M-of-N multsig. In our example, the sharing of the private keys would look as follows:

        Alice   ->      Bob

        Bob     ->      Carol

        Carol   ->      Alice

        Now, each participant holds two private keys that he/she can use to collude with another party to successfully sign the inputs and make a transaction. But no single party holds enough keys (3 of 3) to be able to independently make the transaction.

Important
---------

There are some general rules (repeated once again for convenience) which should be followed while working with multisignature addresses (and in general with IOTA):

Signing order is important
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When creating a multi-signature address and when signing a transaction for that address, it is important to follow the exact order that was used during the initial creation. If we have a multi-signature address that was signed in the following order: Alice -> Bob -> Carol. You will not be able to spend these inputs if you provide the signatures in a different order (e.g. Bob -> Alice -> Carol). As such, keep the signing order in mind.

Never re-use keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Probably the most important rule to keep in mind: absolutely never re-use private keys. IOTA uses one-time Winternitz signatures, which means that if you re-use private keys you significantly decrease the security of your private keys, up to the point where signing of another transaction can be done on a conventional computer within few days. Therefore, when generating a new multi-signature with your co-signers, always increase the private key **index counter** and only use a single private key once. Don't use it for any other multi-signatures and don't use it for any personal transactions.

Never share your private keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Under no circumstances - other than wanting to reduce the requirements for a multi-signature (see section **How M-of-N works**) - should you share your private keys. Sharing your private keys with others means that they can sign your part of the multi-signature successfully.
