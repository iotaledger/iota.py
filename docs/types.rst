Basic Concepts
==============

Before diving into the API, it's important to understand the fundamental
data types of IOTA.

:todo: Link to IOTA docs

PyOTA Types
===========

PyOTA defines a few types that will make it easy for you to model
objects like Transactions and Bundles in your own code.

TryteString
-----------

.. code:: python

    from iota import TryteString

    trytes_1 = TryteString(b'RBTC9D9DCDQAEASBYBCCKBFA')
    trytes_2 = TryteString(b'LH9GYEMHCF9GWHZFEELHVFOEOHNEEEWHZFUD')

    if trytes_1 != trytes_2:
      trytes_combined = trytes_1 + trytes_2

    index = {
      trytes_1: 42,
      trytes_2: 86,
    }

A ``TryteString`` is an ASCII representation of a sequence of trytes. In
many respects, it is similar to a Python ``bytes`` object (which is an
ASCII representation of a sequence of bytes).

In fact, the two objects behave very similarly; they support
concatenation, comparison, can be used as dict keys, etc.

However, unlike ``bytes``, a ``TryteString`` can only contain uppercase
letters and the number 9 (as a regular expression: ``^[A-Z9]*$``).

As you go through the API documentation, you will see many references to
``TryteString`` and its subclasses:

-  ``Fragment``: A signature or message fragment inside a transaction.
   Fragments are always 2187 trytes long.
-  ``Hash``: An object identifier. Hashes are always 81 trytes long.
   There are many different types of hashes:
-  ``Address``: Identifies an address on the Tangle.
-  ``BundleHash``: Identifies a bundle on the Tangle.
-  ``TransactionHash``: Identifies a transaction on the Tangle.
-  ``Seed``: A TryteString that is used for crypto functions such as
   generating addresses, signing inputs, etc. Seeds can be any length,
   but 81 trytes offers the best security.
-  ``Tag``: A tag used to classify a transaction. Tags are always 27
   trytes long.
-  ``TransactionTrytes``: A TryteString representation of a transaction
   on the Tangle. ``TransactionTrytes`` are always 2673 trytes long.

Encoding
~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    from iota import TryteString

    message_trytes = TryteString.from_unicode('Hello, IOTA!')

To encode character data into trytes, use the
``TryteString.from_unicode`` method.

You can also convert a tryte sequence into characters using
``TryteString.decode``. Note that not every tryte sequence can be
converted; garbage in, garbage out!

.. code:: python

    from iota import TryteString

    trytes = TryteString(b'RBTC9D9DCDQAEASBYBCCKBFA')
    message = trytes.decode()

.. note::

    PyOTA also supports encoding non-ASCII characters, but this functionality is
    **experimental** and has not yet been evaluated by the IOTA
    community!

    Until this feature has been standardized, it is recommended that you only
    use ASCII characters when generating ``TryteString`` objects from
    character strings.

Transaction Types
-----------------

PyOTA defines two different types used to represent transactions:

Transaction
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    from iota import Address, ProposedTransaction, Tag, Transaction

    txn_1 =\
      Transaction.from_tryte_string(

``Transaction`` is a transaction that has been loaded from the Tangle.

Generally, you will never need to create ``Transaction`` objects; the
API will build them for you, as the result of various API methods.

Each ``Transaction`` has the following attributes:

-  ``address: Address``: The address associated with this transaction.
   Depending on the transaction's ``value``, this address may be a
   sender or a recipient.
-  ``attachment_timestamp: int``: Estimated epoch time of the attachment to the tangle.
-  ``attachment_time_lower_bound: int``: The lowest possible epoch time of the attachment to the tangle.
-  ``attachment_time_upper_bound: int``: The highest possible epoch time of the attachment to the tangle.
-  ``branch_transaction_hash: TransactionHash``: An unrelated
   transaction that this transaction "approves". Refer to the Basic
   Concepts section for more information.
-  ``bundle_hash: BundleHash``: The bundle hash, used to identify
   transactions that are part of the same bundle. This value is
   generated by taking a hash of the metadata from all transactions in
   the bundle.
-  ``current_index: int``: The transaction's position in the bundle.
-  If the ``current_index`` value is 0, then this is the "tail
   transaction".
-  If it is equal to ``last_index``, then this is the "head
   transaction".
-  ``hash: TransactionHash``: The transaction hash, used to uniquely
   identify the transaction on the Tangle. This value is generated by
   taking a hash of the raw transaction trits.
-  ``is_confirmed: Optional[bool]``: Whether this transaction has been
   "confirmed". Refer to the Basic Concepts section for more
   information.
-  ``last_index: int``: The index of the final transaction in the
   bundle. This value is attached to every transaction to make it easier
   to traverse and verify bundles.
-  ``legacy_tag: Tag``: A short message attached to the transaction. Deprecated, use ``tag`` instead.
-  ``nonce: Hash``: This is the product of the PoW process.
-  ``signature_message_fragment: Fragment``: Additional data attached to
   the transaction:
-  If ``value < 0``, this value contains a fragment of the cryptographic
   signature authorizing the spending of the IOTAs.
-  If ``value > 0``, this value is an (optional) string message attached
   to the transaction.
-  If ``value = 0``, this value could be either a signature or message
   fragment, depending on the previous transaction.
-  ``tag: Tag``: Used to classify the transaction. Many transactions
   have empty tags (``Tag(b'999999999999999999999999999')``).
-  ``timestamp: int``: Unix timestamp when the transaction was created.
   Note that devices can specify any timestamp when creating
   transactions, so this value is not safe to use for security measures
   (such as resolving double-spends).
-  ``trunk_transaction_hash: TransactionHash``: The transaction hash of
   the next transaction in the bundle. If this transaction is the head
   transaction, its ``trunk_transaction_hash`` will be pseudo-randomly
   selected, similarly to ``branch_transaction_hash``.
-  ``value: int``: The number of IOTAs being transferred in this
   transaction:
-  If this value is negative, then the ``address`` is spending IOTAs.
-  If it is positive, then the ``address`` is receiving IOTAs.
-  If it is zero, then this transaction is being used to carry metadata
   (such as a signature fragment or a message) instead of transferring
   IOTAs.

ProposedTransaction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``ProposedTransaction`` is a transaction that was created locally and
hasn't been broadcast yet.

.. code:: python

    txn_2 =\
      ProposedTransaction(
        address =
          Address(
            b'TESTVALUE9DONTUSEINPRODUCTION99999XE9IVG'
            b'EFNDOCQCMERGUATCIEGGOHPHGFIAQEZGNHQ9W99CH'
          ),

        message = TryteString.from_unicode('thx fur cheezburgers'),
        tag     = Tag(b'KITTEHS'),
        value   = 42,
      )

This type is useful when creating new transactions to broadcast to the
Tangle. Note that creating a ``ProposedTransaction`` requires only a
small subset of the attributes needed to create a ``Transaction``
object.

To create a ``ProposedTransaction``, specify the following values:

-  ``address: Address``: The address associated with the transaction.
   Note that each transaction references exactly one address; in order
   to transfer IOTAs from one address to another, you must create at
   least two transactions: One to deduct the IOTAs from the sender's
   balance, and one to add the IOTAs to the recipient's balance.
-  ``message: Optional[TryteString]``: Optional trytes to attach to the
   transaction. This could be any value (character strings, binary data,
   or raw trytes), as long as it's converted to a ``TryteString`` first.
-  ``tag: Optional[Tag]``: Optional tag to classify this transaction.
   Each transaction may have exactly one tag, and the tag is limited to
   27 trytes.
-  ``value: int``: The number of IOTAs being transferred in this
   transaction. This value can be 0; for example, to send a message
   without spending any IOTAs.

Bundle Types
------------

As with transactions, PyOTA defines two bundle types.

Bundle
~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    from iota import Bundle

    bundle = Bundle.from_tryte_strings([
      b'GYPRVHBEZOOFXSHQBLCYW9ICTCISLHDBNMMVYD9JJHQMPQCTIQAQTJNNNJ9IDXLRCC...',
      b'OYOXYPCLR9PBEY9ORZIEPPDNTI9CQWYZUOTAVBXPSBOFEQAPFLWXSWUIUSJMSJIIIZ...',
      # etc.
    ])

``Bundle`` represents a bundle of transactions published on the Tangle.
It is intended to be a read-only object, allowing you to inspect the
transactions and bundle metadata.

Each bundle has the following attributes:

-  ``hash: BundleHash``: The hash of this bundle. This value is
   generated by taking a hash of the metadata from all transactions in
   the bundle.
-  ``is_confirmed: Optional[bool]``: Whether the transactions in this
   bundle have been confirmed. Refer to the Basic Concepts section for
   more information.
-  ``tail_transaction: Optional[Transaction]``: The bundle's tail
   transaction.
-  ``transactions: List[Transaction]``: The transactions associated with
   this bundle.

ProposedBundle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

    from iota import Address, ProposedBundle, ProposedTransaction
    from iota.crypto.signing import KeyGenerator

    bundle = ProposedBundle()

    bundle.add_transaction(ProposedTransaction(...))
    bundle.add_transaction(ProposedTransaction(...))
    bundle.add_transaction(ProposedTransaction(...))

    bundle.add_inputs([
      Address(
        address =
          b'TESTVALUE9DONTUSEINPRODUCTION99999HAA9UA'
          b'MHCGKEUGYFUBIARAXBFASGLCHCBEVGTBDCSAEBTBM',

        balance   = 86,
        key_index = 0,
      ),
    ])

    bundle.send_unspent_inputs_to(
      Address(
        b'TESTVALUE9DONTUSEINPRODUCTION99999D99HEA'
        b'M9XADCPFJDFANCIHR9OBDHTAGGE9TGCI9EO9ZCRBN'
      ),
    )

    bundle.finalize()
    bundle.sign_inputs(KeyGenerator(b'SEED9GOES9HERE'))

.. note::

    This section contains information about how PyOTA works "under the
    hood".

        The ``prepare_transfer`` API method encapsulates this functionality
        for you; it is not necessary to understand how ``ProposedBundle``
        works in order to use PyOTA.


``ProposedBundle`` provides a convenient interface for creating new
bundles, listed in the order that they should be invoked:

-  ``add_transaction: (ProposedTransaction) -> None``: Adds a
   transaction to the bundle. If necessary, it may split the transaction
   into multiple (for example, if the transaction's message is too long
   to fit into 2187 trytes).
-  ``add_inputs: (List[Address]) -> None``: Specifies inputs that can be
   used to fund transactions that spend IOTAs. The ``ProposedBundle``
   will use these to create the necessary input transactions.
-  You can use the ``get_inputs`` API command to find suitable inputs.
-  ``send_unspent_inputs_to: (Address) -> None``: Specifies the address
   that will receive unspent IOTAs. The ``ProposedBundle`` will use this
   to create the necessary change transaction, if necessary.
-  ``finalize: () -> None``: Prepares the bundle for PoW. Once this
   method is invoked, no new transactions may be added to the bundle.
-  ``sign_inputs: (KeyGenerator) -> None``: Generates the necessary
   cryptographic signatures to authorize spending the inputs. You do not
   need to invoke this method if the bundle does not contain any
   transactions that spend IOTAs.

Once the ``ProposedBundle`` has been finalized (and inputs signed, if
necessary), invoke its ``as_tryte_strings`` method to generate the raw
trytes that should be included in an ``attach_to_tangle`` API request.
