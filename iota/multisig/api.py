    Prepares a bundle that authorizes the spending of IOTAs from a
    multisig address.

    Note: if you want to spend IOTAs from non-multisig addresses, or if
    you want to create 0-value transfers (i.e., that don't require
    inputs), you can use :py:meth:`iota.api.Iota.prepare_transfer`
    instead.

    :param transfers:
      Transaction objects to prepare.

      Important: Must include at least one transaction that spends
      IOTAs (has a nonzero ``value``).  If you want to prepare a bundle
      that does not spend any IOTAs, use
      :py:meth:`iota.api.prepare_transfer` instead.

    :param multisig_input:
      The multisig address to use as the input for the transfers.

      Note: a bundle may contain only one multisig input.

    :param change_address:
      If inputs are provided, any unspent amount will be sent to this
      address.  If the bundle has no unspent inputs, ``change_address`
      is ignored.

      Unlike :py:meth:`iota.api.Iota.prepare_transfer`, this method
      will NOT generate a change address automatically.  If there are
      unspent inputs and ``change_address`` is empty, an exception will
      be raised.

      This is because multisig transactions typically involve multiple
      individuals, and it would be unfair to the participants if we
      generated a change address automatically using the seed of
      whoever happened to run the ``prepare_multisig_transfer`` method!

      Note: this is not a substitute for due diligence! Always verify
      the details of every transaction in a bundle (including the
      change transaction) before signing the input(s)!

             The input transactions are not signed.
         }

      In order to authorize the spending of IOTAs from the multisig
      input, you must generate the correct private keys and invoke the
      :py:meth:`iota.crypto.types.PrivateKey.sign_input_at` method for
      each key, in the correct order.

      Once the correct signatures are applied, you can then perform
      proof of work (``attachToTangle``) and broadcast the bundle using
      :py:meth:`iota.api.Iota.send_trytes`.
